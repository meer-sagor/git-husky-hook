> **Git Commit troubleshooting**

In your project we follow [git conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). please follow the commit rules.
> **unfamiliar with git conventional commit?**

Don't worry about that we have another setup in your project called [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli). after tracking all changes file then run `npx cz` in your terminal and follow the instructions.

Happy coding!!
